### Libraries

 - **React** - A great tool to creat UI, because give us possibility to create reusable components.
 - **Redux** - Create global store rather than pass down a lot of props is a great advantages of Redux.
 - **Redux Saga** - I use it instead of Redux Thunk. In my opinion this library is significiant better because base on events and if you want to handle some async actions you don;t need a lot of code like in Redux Thunk.
 - **reselect** - This is library which allow us to get data from state in one place. In this case, any of store chane won't be ver harmfulll. 
 - **D3.js** - I don't use all library. I choose this module which I really need. This is one of advantages of this library. It is efficient and very popular (with great community) library to create charts.
 - **material-ui, bounty** - Libraries which provide utils which allow me to create UI faster.
